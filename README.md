# 🚀 Reinforcement Learning (RL) Study & Research Repository

Welcome to my **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** learning and research repository!  
This repo serves as a **personal knowledge hub** for studying, comparing, and experimenting with RL theories, papers, and algorithms.

## 📌 Repo Structure & Purpose

This repository is structured around five key components:

### 📖 1. **Fundamentals of Reinforcement Learning**
- Notes and summaries on RL basics:  
  - MDP, Bellman Equation, Policy Gradient, Actor-Critic, etc.
- Comparisons of different RL paradigms:  
  - Model-free vs. Model-based  
  - Online vs. Offline  
  - Value-based vs. Policy-based

### 📄 2. **Reading Notes on Recent Papers**
- Summaries, insights, and key takeaways from recent top-tier RL papers (NeurIPS, ICLR, ICML, etc.)
- Focus on:
  - Offline RL
  - RL with human feedback
  - Multi-agent RL

### ⚙️ 3. **Reproduction of Classic & Cutting-edge Algorithms**
- Implementations of key algorithms from scratch or using PyTorch/TensorFlow:
  - Q-Learning, DQN, PPO, A3C, SAC, DDPG, etc.
  - Offline RL methods: BCQ, CQL, IQL, Decision Transformer
- Reproducibility is a key goal with clean, readable code

### 🧪 4. **Experimental Test Beds**
- Environments and tools for RL experimentation:
  - Gym, D4RL, MiniGrid, Meta-World
  - Custom wrappers and logging tools for better experiment tracking

### 📚 5. **Other Resources**
- Curated reading list
- Links to useful libraries, courses, and benchmarks
- Tools for visualization and debugging
